You can also see some planets and their moons, either with the naked eye or with the help of a telescope. These celestial bodies are different from the stars in one important way. Stars are celestial bodies that produce their own heat and light. Planets and their moons shine by reflecting the light of a star such as our sun.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem;"></span>
                    <br>
                    <br>All stars are huge balls of hydrogen and helium gases. In a star, hydrogen gets converted into helium. In this reaction, a large amount of energy is liberated. This is the source of the heat and light of a star. Stars vary in brightness and size. Some are medium-sized, like our sun. Some are so huge that if they were to be placed in our sun’s position, they would fill the entire solar system!

                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2">As the earth moves round the sun, we see different stars at different times of the year. In the past, people found many uses for this. For example, they would get ready for sowing when particular stars appeared in the sky. Obviously, it was not possible for them to identify each and every star. So, they looked for groups of stars which seem to form patterns in the sky. A group of stars which seem to form a pattern is called a constellation.<br>

                    </span>r (Ursa Major) is one of the easiest constellations to spot. You can see it between February and May. Its seven brightest stars form the shape of a dipper (a long-handled spoon used for drawing out water). Together, these stars are called the Big Dipper or Saptarshi. These and the other stars of the constellation roughly form the shape of a bear.<br>
                    <br>The two brightest stars of the Big Dipper are called ‘pointers’ because they point towards the pole star. The pole star lies at the tail of the bear of a smaller constellation called the Little Bear (Ursa Minor).&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>To find the north direction, ancient travellers would look for the Big Dipper and from there, locate the pole star. While all stars seem to move from the east to the west (as the earth rotates in the opposite direction), the pole star seems fixed.<br>

According to one, the mighty hunter Orion vowed to kill all the animals of the world. Alarmed at this, the Earth Goddess sent a scorpion to kill Orion. He ran away, and continues to do so even now. This story takes into account the fact that Orion goes below the horizon when Scorpius rises. Orion rises again only when Scorpius sets.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> Remember that constellations are imaginary. For our convenience we have picked a few stars that resemble a pattern and called them a constellation. On the other hand, galaxies are real things in which stars and other celestial bodies are held together by gravitational force.

                  </h2>
                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"> A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.<br>
                    <br>The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed." If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

It is about 333,000 times heavier than the earth, and you could fit more than a million earths inside it! Its great mass causes a large gravitational force. This keeps the sun, the planets, their moons and some other smaller bodies together as the sun’s family. The sun and all the bodies moving around it are together called the solar system. All the members of the solar system revolve around the sun in almost circular paths, or orbits.</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> After the sun, the planets are the largest bodies in our solar system. Scientists define a planet as a round body that orbits the sun and which has pulled in all objects near its orbit. Remember that planets were formed when large bodies in space pulled in smaller bodies near it. This cleared the space around a planet’s orbit.<br>
                    <br>There are eight planets in our solar system. In order of distance from the sun they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You can remember this order as My Very Efficient Maid Just Served Us Noodles.<br>
                    <br>Apart from revolving around the sun, each planet rotates, or spins, about its axis. The time taken to complete a revolution around the sun is the length of a planet’s year. And the time taken to complete one rotation is the planet’s day.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>The four planets closest to the sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are small, rocky planets. They are called terrestrial (earthlike) planets. The other four planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are giants in comparison.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>They are made up mainly of gases. They are called gas giants or Jovian (Jupiter like) planets. All the gas giants have rings around them. Since they are very far from the sun, the gas giants are much colder than the terrestrial planets.<br>
                    <br>While stars twinkle, planets shine with a steady light. You can see some of the planets with the naked eyes or with the help of a good pair of binoculars. Just remember that as the planets move around the sun, they appear at different positions in the sky at different times of the year. And for the period they are behind the sun, they are not visible.

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Mercury, the smallest planet of our solar system, revolves around the sun the fastest. But it rotates on its axis at a much slower speed than the earth. So, a day on Mercury is about 58 times longer than a day on earth.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>Although Mercury is the closest to the sun, it is not the hottest planet. Its thin atmosphere cannot trap heat. So, at night, when there is no sun, the temperature can fall to as low as -180°C. You can see Mercury near the eastern horizon before sunrise at certain times of the year. And at certain other times, you can see it near the western horizon after sunset.

                    <br>Venus takes 243 days to complete one rotation, making its day the longest in the solar system. As a matter of fact, a day on Venus is longer than its year! It is easy to spot Venus because it is so bright. When it is visible in the east before sunrise, it is called a morning star. And when it is visible in the west in the evening, it is called an evening star.

The planet’s distance from the sun, the composition of its atmosphere and the fact that liquid water is found on it make life possible on it.<br>
                    <br>Were it nearer the sun, the water on it would have evaporated. Were it farther away, all our oceans, rivers and lakes would have frozen. The carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere plays two important roles. Plants use it to make food—which feeds, directly or indirectly, all animals. It also traps just enough heat to ensure that the nights on earth do not become freezing cold.

Not only were we interested in its beautiful rings, we were also interested in its magnificent colors. Saturn is one of the most intriguing phenomenons known in the Milky Way.<br>
                    <br>Saturn is one of the five planets that you can see from Earth, though it will only be seen as a star figure. From miles away saturn looks like a solid planet. Looks can be deceiving because it is actually one of the least dense planets since it is a very gaseous planet. It has such low density to the point where if you put Saturn in an enormous pool of water, it would actually float! Saturn is 94% hydrogen and 6% helium and small amounts of methane and ammonia.

The planet appears to be blue-green because the atmosphere absorbs the, red wavelengths of the visible spectrum, . The uniformity of the planet's appearance confirms that the planet's atmosphere is composed almost solely of one element, methane gas. There is a preponderance of haze, composed of ethane and other hydrocarbon ices high in the stratosphere, and clouds of methane ice low in the troposphere. The cloud particles constantly recycle themselves, first creating then destroying the heaviest crystals. This is an indication that Uranus' atmosphere is still evolving from its formation out of the solar nebula. Because <br>
                    <br>The magnetosphere of Uranus has a very strange orientation, tilted by almost 60 degrees from the vertical. The extreme tilt, combined with the extreme tilt of the rotation axis of Uranus, provides for a completely unique magnetosphere, one which has a twisting structure!

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Roughly, 30.1 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun (Chaisson &amp; McMillan, 2011 p. 316) there is a cold, dark, lifeless planet. We call this planet Neptune, after the Roman god of the sea. The planet Neptune is a very complex one with many different facets. The following will discuss nearly every aspect of the planet from its history, to the general composition of the planet, and everything in between.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>Neptune began just as all the other planets in our solar system did and the condensation theory describes the process of how they formed (Chaisson &amp; McMillan, 2011 p. 147). The basic thought process behind the condensation theory is that when a star is born a dust and gas cloud forms and begins rotating around the parent star,<br>&nbsp;<br>. This means that Neptune did not complete one full orbit around the Sun until July of this year. This full orbit marked Neptune’s first birthday since its discovery. The discovery and creation of the planet are very interesting. However, how do we study and learn more about Neptune? Neptune is the only planet in our solar system that cannot be studied without the aid of an optical tool such as binoculars or a small telescope (“Neptune Celebrates”, 2011). Neptune cannot be seen without the aid of an optical device because it has an apparent magnitude of +7.8 (Carina, 1990-2008) and our naked eyes can only see objects with a magnitude of +6 (Chaisson &amp; McMillan, 2011).

                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"> Asteroids were not the only pieces of rock left over from the formation of the solar system. Some others, called meteoroids, still orbit the sun. When they come very close to a planet such as the earth, gravitation pulls them in.<br>
                    <br>As they enter the earth’s atmosphere, they heat up because of friction with the air, and start burning. As these burning meteoroids fall towards the ground, we see them as streaks of light. The streak of light caused by a burning meteoroid is called a meteor or a shooting star.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>Fortunately, the material of most meteoroids burns up completely before it can reach the surface of the earth. However, some large ones fail to burn up completely and strike the earth’s surface. Meteoroids that fall on a planet or a moon are called meteorites. A large meteorite can create a large crater and cause a lot of damage.<br>
                    <br>Scientists think that dinosaurs were wiped off the earth following a meteorite hit. Meteorite hits are more common on those planets and moons which have little or no atmosphere to burn off the falling rock. The craters on our moon have resulted from meteorite hits.<br>

                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"> A comet is a small body of ice and dust that moves around the sun in an elongated orbit. As a comet approaches the sun, it heats up and leaves behind a stream of hot, glowing gases and dust particles. We see this as the ‘tail’ of the comet.<br>
                    <br>Comets take many years to complete an orbit around the sun. For example, Halley’s Comet takes 76 years to go around the sun. Some comets come from outside the solar system, and after going around the sun they go back, perhaps never to return again.
